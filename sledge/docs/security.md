# Security Documentation

## Overview

Sledge implements a comprehensive security system with multiple layers of protection and future integration with the Fonce security application.

## Components

### 1. Request Interceptor (`interceptor.py`)

The request interceptor provides real-time request filtering and security header management:

```python
class RequestInterceptor:
    # Blocked dangerous schemes
    blocked_schemes = {'file', 'ftp', 'data', 'javascript'}
    
    # Blocked dangerous ports
    blocked_ports = {21, 22, 23, 25, 465, 587}
```

#### Security Headers
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy
- CORS headers

#### Request Filtering
- Scheme blocking
- Port blocking
- Suspicious pattern detection
- Mixed content blocking

### 2. Security Panel (`panel.py`)

User interface for security configuration:

#### Features
- Developer Mode toggle
- CORS policy settings
- Mixed content blocking
- Dangerous port/scheme blocking

#### States
- Normal Mode: Full security features
- Developer Mode: Relaxed security for development

### 3. Defense Module (Future - Fonce Integration)

Located in `security/defense/`, prepared for Fonce integration:

#### Components
- `browser.py`: Browser-specific security handling
- `event_handler.py`: Security event processing
- `monitor.py`: Real-time security monitoring

## Security Best Practices

### Development Mode
1. Only enable in trusted development environments
2. Monitor the console for security warnings
3. Re-enable security features before production use

### CORS Policy
1. Keep strict CORS enabled by default
2. Use developer mode for cross-origin development
3. Monitor blocked requests in the console

### Request Monitoring
1. Check console for suspicious request patterns
2. Review blocked schemes and ports
3. Monitor mixed content warnings

## Future Security Features

### Fonce Integration
1. Real-time threat detection
2. Security policy enforcement
3. Advanced event monitoring
4. Content security analysis

### Planned Enhancements
1. Certificate management
2. Enhanced privacy features
3. Security logging system
4. Threat analytics
